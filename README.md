Easy .smali file patcher without need of lines or hunks match. Easy to maintain for Android ROM Projects
 (smalipatch.py)
Simple Smali Method Patcher (smalipatch.py)A lightweight Python 3 utility designed for applying method body replacements to disassembled Android Smali files using a clean, human-readable patch format. Ideal for automation in reverse engineering workflows.üöÄ Getting StartedPrerequisitesThis script requires Python 3.#!/usr/bin/env python3
UsageThe script is executed via the command line and requires two arguments: the working directory (root of the decompiled APK) and the patch file.python3 smalipatch.py <work_dir> <patch_file.smalipatch>
Example ExecutionIf your disassembled application files are located in apk_unpacked/ and your patch is in a subdirectory:python3 smalipatch.py ./apk_unpacked ./patches/no-signature-check.smalipatch
Success Output:SUCCESS: Replaced method in target/smali/com/example/PackageVerification.smali
 .smalipatch Format SpecificationA patch file must define three mandatory sections in order: the target file, the action/method signature, and the new patch content.Line 1: Target FileSpecify the relative path to the Smali file from your <work_dir>.DirectiveExampleFILEFILE smali_classes2/com/app/core/Signer.smaliLine 2: Action and Method SignatureSpecify the action and the full, unambiguous signature of the method you wish to target.ActionDescriptionStatusREPLACEReplaces the entire method body (everything between the .method and .end method lines) with the new patch content.‚úÖ ImplementedMODIFYReserved for future line-by-line insertion/deletion logic.‚è∏Ô∏è PendingExample SignatureREPLACE .method public static blacklist getMinimumSignatureSchemeVersionForTargetSdk(I)ILines 3+: Patch ContentThis section contains the new Smali instructions. Do NOT include the .method ... or .end method lines here; the script handles those boundaries.üí° Practical ExampleThis example demonstrates how to use the patcher to disable a strict signature check by forcing the method to always return 1 (Signature Scheme v1).no-signature-check.smalipatchFILE android/util/apk/PackageVerification.smali
REPLACE .method public static blacklist getMinimumSignatureSchemeVersionForTargetSdk(I)I
    .locals 1
    .param p0, "targetSdk"    # I

    .line 573
    const/4 v0, 0x1
    return v0
 Resulting Smali File Content (Excerpt)The target file is successfully modified to contain only the patch code within the method block:.method public static blacklist getMinimumSignatureSchemeVersionForTargetSdk(I)I
    .locals 1
    .param p0, "targetSdk"    # I

    .line 573
    const/4 v0, 0x1
    return v0
.end method
