# smali_patch
Easy .smali file patcher without need of lines or hunks match. Easy to maintain for Android ROM Projects
 (smalipatch.py)
A lightweight Python 3 utility designed for applying method body replacements to disassembled Android Smali files using a clean, human-readable patch format. Ideal for automation in reverse engineering workflows.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
This script requires Python 3.

#!/usr/bin/env python3

Usage
The script is executed via the command line and requires two arguments: the working directory (root of the decompiled APK) and the patch file.

python3 smalipatch.py <work_dir> <patch_file.smalipatch>

Example Execution
If your disassembled application files are located in apk_unpacked/ and your patch is in a subdirectory:

python3 smalipatch.py ./apk_unpacked ./patches/no-signature-check.smalipatch

Success Output:

SUCCESS: Replaced method in target/smali/com/example/PackageVerification.smali

 .smalipatch Format Specification
A patch file must define three mandatory sections in order: the target file, the action/method signature, and the new patch content.

Line 1: Target File
Specify the relative path to the Smali file from your <work_dir>.

Directive

Example

FILE

FILE smali_classes2/com/app/core/Signer.smali

Line 2: Action and Method Signature
Specify the action and the full, unambiguous signature of the method you wish to target.

Action

Description

Status

REPLACE

Replaces the entire method body (everything between the .method and .end method lines) with the new patch content.

 Implemented

MODIFY

Reserved for future line-by-line insertion/deletion logic.

Pending

Example Signature

REPLACE .method public static blacklist getMinimumSignatureSchemeVersionForTargetSdk(I)I

Lines 3+: Patch Content
This section contains the new Smali instructions. Do NOT include the .method ... or .end method lines here; the script handles those boundaries.

 Practical Example
This example demonstrates how to use the patcher to disable a strict signature check by forcing the method to always return 1 (Signature Scheme v1).

no-signature-check.smalipatch
FILE android/util/apk/PackageVerification.smali
REPLACE .method public static blacklist getMinimumSignatureSchemeVersionForTargetSdk(I)I
    .locals 1
    .param p0, "targetSdk"    # I

    .line 573
    const/4 v0, 0x1
    return v0

 Resulting Smali File Content (Excerpt)
The target file is successfully modified to contain only the patch code within the method block:

.method public static blacklist getMinimumSignatureSchemeVersionForTargetSdk(I)I
    .locals 1
    .param p0, "targetSdk"    # I

    .line 573
    const/4 v0, 0x1
    return v0
.end method
